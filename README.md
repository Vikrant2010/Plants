# Auto Pot
*WHAT IS IT?*




It is a self watering plant which uses a moisture sensor to detect the moisture of the soil using CSS. If the moisture is low then it waters the plant.This helps people with their daily gargening keeping their plants healthy.


We used Adruino for the hardware.


*INSTRUCTIONS*



- Sit back and relax, let the Auto-Pot water your plant. (Also fill the tank with water)
